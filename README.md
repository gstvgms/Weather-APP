# ☀️ Weather App in Java ☔

## 📝 Description

This is a project inspired by the video “Weather App - Java Beginner Project Tutorial” from the [TapTap_196 channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZcEYv2ezWc&t). The project was built entirely in Java Swing, presenting a graphical user interface (GUI) for an application that queries city temperatures and details such as wind speed and humidity. 🌡️💨

During the development of this project, I learned how to consume an API in Java, use a JSON Array and a JSON object, as well as applying some knowledge acquired during my ongoing degree, such as method creation, parameter passing and others. 🎓💻

## 🚀 Modifications and improvements

Some changes have already been implemented, such as a placeholder in the city search bar. This feature will still be improved, following my pace of learning and given that it is presenting some problems. 🔄

Future implementations that have been considered are: availability of favoriting cities and location search history. 🌍💖

## 📡 API

The open-source API open-meteo.com was consumed.
